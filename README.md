# restful-rust

a sample Rocket/Diesel app to explore a practical use of Rust for modern Web Backend

if you want to run this on your own you will want to set up postgres and install diesel-cli so you can run the migrations before you start
this will also require creating a .env file with your DATABASE_URL
